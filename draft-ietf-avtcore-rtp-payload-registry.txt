        Closing the RTP Payload Format Media Types IANA Registry
             draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-payload-registry-latest

Abstract

   It has been observed that specifications of new RTP payload formats
   often forget to register themselves in the IANA registry "RTP Payload
   Formats Media Types".  In practice this has no real impact.  One
   reason is that the Media Types registry is the crucial registry to
   register any Media Type to establish the media type used to
   identified the format in various signaling usage.

   This document resolves the situation by first updating the RTP
   Payload Format Media Type registry to include all the known RTP
   payload formats at the time of writing, then it closes this IANA
   Registry for any future registration.  Beyond instructing IANA to
   close this registry, the instructions to authors in RFC 8088 are
   updated to reflect this.

1.  Introduction

   It has been observed that specifications of new RTP payload formats
   often forget to register themselves in the IANA registry "RTP Payload
   formats Media Types" [RTP-FORMATS].  In practice this has no real
   impact.  This registry is not used for any purpose other than to
   track which media types actually have RTP payload formats.  That
   purpose could be addressed through other means.

   The Media Types registry [MEDIA-TYPES] is the crucial registry to
   register any Media Type to establish the media type used to identify
   the format in various signalling usage, to avoid collisions, and to
   reference their specifications.

   To resolve this situation, this document performs the following
   actions.  First, it updates the registry to include known RTP payload
   formats at the time of writing.  Then, it closes the IANA Registry
   for RTP Payload Formats Media Types for future registration.  Beyond
   instructing IANA to close this registry, the instructions to authors
   in [RFC8088] are updated so that registration in the closed registry
   is no longer mentioned.

   It is unclear how the "RTP Payload formats Media Types" [RTP-FORMATS]
   registry came into existence.  The registry references [RFC4855] as
   the instructions for this registry.  However, reviewing that RFC we
   have been unable to find any text that defines its purpose and rules.
   Further attempts to find how the registry was created have failed to
   find any reference to its creation.  It is likely this was created
   based on email or AD request.  Thus, there is no known existing
   specification for this registry that needs to be updated when closing
   the registry.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Update to How To Write an RTP Payload Format

   How to write an RTP Payload format [RFC8088] mandates that RTP
   Payload formats shall register in RTP Payload Format media types:

   "Since all RTP payload formats contain a media type specification,
   they also need an IANA Considerations section.  The media type name
   must be registered, and this is done by requesting that IANA register
   that media name.  When that registration request is written, it shall
   also be requested that the media type is included under the "RTP
   Payload Format media types" sub-registry of the RTP registry
   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/rtp-parameters)."

   This paragraph is changed to the following:

   "Since all RTP payload formats contain a media type specification,
   they also need an IANA Considerations section.  The media type name
   must be registered, and this is done by requesting that IANA register
   that media name."

   Thus removing the need to register in the "RTP Payload Format media
   types".

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following missing RTP Payload types to
   the "RTP Payload Format Media Types" registry [RTP-FORMATS].

    +=====+====+=======+==========+===================================+

       Table 1: Payload Types to Register in RTP Payload Format Media
                                   Types

   IANA is further requested to close the "RTP Payload Format Media
   Types" registry [RTP-FORMATS] for any further registrations.  IANA
   should add the following to the note to the registry:

   "This registry has been closed as it was considered redundant as all
   RTP Payload formats are part of the Media Types registry
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).
   For further motivation see (RFC-TBD1)."

   RFC-Editor Note: Please replace RFC-TBD1 with the RFC number of this
   specification and then remove this note.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations as it defines an
   administrative rule change.
